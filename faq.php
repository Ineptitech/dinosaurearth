          <div class="q">Where is my country on the Dinosaur?</div>
          <div class="a">Take a close look at <a href="https://dinosaurearthsociety.com/gallery/uploads/06-12-2020-14-12-10-2721.png">this picture of the earth</a>, taken by the ‘’Velociraptor 3’’ satellite from DESA. You will most likely find your country on there. If you can’t find your country, it probably does not exist. The government is known to make up fictional countries such as New Zealand and Finland. </div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">How can I join the society?</div>
          <div class="a">Following the Dinosaur Earth Society on social media is enough to be considered a member. Currently, this is the only way to join, as official membership is not available (yet). </div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">How can I express that I'm a Dinosaur Earther?</div>
          <div class="a">For the devout dinosaur earthers amongst us, there are more profound ways to express your beliefs, such as Dinosaur Earth clothing and other merchandise. For the less devout and shy believers, it is sufficient to post the truth on social media. </div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">A loved one of mine thinks the earth is round(or flat). What do I do?</div>
          <div class="a">This is a very unpleasant scenario. If you find yourself in a situation like this, don’t get mad at your loved one. They are brainwashed by NASA, it’s not their fault. The best thing you can do, is telling them about dinosaur earth each day. Make sure to do this consistently, even when it takes very long. Eventually, NASA will lose control of the victim. </div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">What are other celestial bodies shaped like?</div>
          <div class="a">The vast majority of bodies in the universe are observed to be spherical. This goes for all stars, every gas planet and almost every rocky planet. Currently, the earth is the only known celestial body to be dinosaur shaped. It’s an unscientific assumption that all celestial bodies are dinosaur-shaped.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">Is the earth a living dinosaur?</div>
          <div class="a">No. The earth does not show metabolic activity, neither does it grow, reproduce or show signs of consciousness. Besides that, the earth mainly consists of inorganic matter, such as rocks. It is therefore safe to assume the earth is not a living dinosaur.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">What type of dinosaur is the earth?</div>
          <div class="a">The earth is observed to have the physical characteristics of a Velociraptor, a subspecies of the Dromaeosauridae family.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">People have been into space. How have they not discovered the earth is dinosaur-shaped?</div>
          <div class="a">Everyone who went into space flew with a NASA spacecraft. NASA has paid them big cash, provided that they’ll be killed when they speak up about the truth of earth’s shape. Nonetheless, two ex-NASA employees have contacted the Dinosaur Earth Society to confirm the earth is dinosaur shaped. Even Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, endorsed the Dinosaur Earth Society. </div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">What evidence do you have?</div>
          <div class="a">The evidence for a dinosaur-shaped earth is derived from many different facets of science and philosophy. The simplest is by relying on one's own senses to discern the true nature of the world around us. Some parts of the earth are curved, other parts are flat. This implies the earth is dinosaur-shaped. Besides that, there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49ph5s-_ATg" target="_blank">satellite footage</a> from a reliable source (not NASA), <a href="https://dinosaurearthsociety.com/gallery/uploads/06-12-2020-14-22-26-lunareclipse1.jpg">lunar eclipses</a> and confessions from ex-NASA employees.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">What about NASA and the Flat Earth Society?</div>
          <div class="a">The Flat Earth Society and NASA both are government organizations, founded for just one purpose: distracting people. They are spreading misinformation and pseudoscience to hide the fact that the earth is dinosaur shaped. Many have fallen for their brainwashing techniques, and many will fall in the future if we don’t stand up and take action.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">Is the Dinosaur Earth Society a joke?</div>
          <div class="a">No. This is another lie spread by NASA and the government to discredit us. They want people to think the Dinosaur Earth Society is just a joke, just a simple laughing matter. They go as far as claiming we’re a parody on the Flat Earth Society. None of this is true, especially when you keep in mind the Flat Earth Society is a distractive organization created by the government.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">What is DESA?</div>
          <div class="a">The Dinosaur Earth Space Agency is a reliable alternative to NASA. DESA has put several satellites in orbit, to which we owe all satellite images.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">Was the earth always Dinosaur-shaped?</div>
          <div class="a">No. Until 73 million years ago the earth was a sphere. Back then, Velociraptors were ruling the earth. They were extremely skilled and intelligent, so intelligent they figured out how to change a planet’s shape. Since velociraptors were rather narcissistic, they decided to shape earth after themselves, as a legacy to all future generations (in their infinite wisdom, they realized their mighty species would not last forever). How they managed to do this, is a mystery as of today, however there’s no doubt they did it. The evidence is still here today.</div>
        </li>
        <li class="faq-item">
          <div class="q">Why is NASA lying about the shape of the earth?</div>
          <div class="a">NASA is the main manufacturer of globes. In order to sell a lot of them, they set up a gigantic propaganda mechanism. The revenue is invested in the persecution of NASA's opponents.</div>
